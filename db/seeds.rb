# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
Product.create([{ code:  'CC', name:  'Coca-Cola', price: 1.50 },
                { code:  'PC', name:  'Pepsi-Cola', price: 2.00 },
                { code:  'WA', name:  'Water', price: 0.85 }])
